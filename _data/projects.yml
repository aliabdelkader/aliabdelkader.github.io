- project: Camera and LiDAR Fusion for Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation
  role: Master thesis
  duration: Jan 2021 &mdash; Jan 2022
  # url: "#"
  description: This project aimed at investigating the best approach to fuse data from LiDAR and Camera's sensors in a deep learning model in order to improve the semantic segmentation of the LiDAR's point cloud. <ol> <li>Different types of fusion approaches were investigated (in the input layers, after features extraction or late fusion at decision heads)</li> <li> State of the models were used for processing image, Vision based Transformer (ViT) and LiDAR point cloud ( Sparse Voxel Convolutional Neural Network )</li> <li>Performance evaluated on the popolar autonomous driving dataset used KiTTi.</li>  <li>Implementation based on deep learning framework (Pytorch, Timm Library)</li> </ol>
